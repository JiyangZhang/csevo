\section{Results and Findings}
\label{sec:eval}

This section describes our experiment results and findings.  We (1)
describe the training details of our experiment, including the
environment and hyper-parameters, (2) show the results for \comgen and
\methnam tasks, and (3) list the key observations and findings from
our experiment.

\subsection{Training Details}
\label{sec:eval:hyparam}

We trained and tested all models on a super computer, where each model
use a NVIDIA GTX 1080-TI GPU and four models share two Intel(R)
Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 CPUs and 128GB of RAM.  We trained and tested each
model in each evaluation setting \NumTrial times and each run is
initialized using different random seed.

We followed the source literature to setup the hyper-parameters of
models. \Fix{...}

\subsection{Results for \ComGen}
\label{sec:eval:results-comgen}

\input{tables/table-ComGen-models-results}

Table~\ref{table:results-com-gen} shows the automatic metrics (\bleu
and \xmatch) for each \methodology (\mixedproj, \crossproj, and
\evoaware) for the models we selected for the \comgen task.

    metrics on all examples in \test set.  Left to right: \mixedproj,

    task. \label{fig:models-results-metrics-dist-ComGen}}

distributions of automatic metrics on examples in \test set.
Figure~\ref{fig:models-results-variance-dist-ComGen} shows the
distributions of the variances of automated metrics on examples in
\test between \NumTrial different trials, where the variance is
calculated as the diff of the maximum value in \NumTrial trials and
minimum value in \NumTrial trials.


\subsection{Results for \MethNam}
\label{sec:eval:results-methnam}

\input{tables/table-MethNam-models-results}

Table~\ref{table:results-meth-nam} shows the automatic metrics (\fone,
\precision, \recall, and \xmatch) for each \methodology (\mixedproj,
\crossproj, and \evoaware) for the models we selected for the \methnam
task.

    metrics on all examples in \test set.  Left to right: \mixedproj,

    task. \label{fig:models-results-metrics-dist-MethNam}}

minimum value in \NumTrial trials.


\subsection{Findings}
\label{sec:eval:findings}
From Table~\ref{}, models trained using \mixedproj \methodology and
\evoaware \methodology perform better in both automatic metrics than
\crossproj \methodology. This is because the using \mixedproj and
\evoaware \methodology models can learn from the
existing method and comment pairs within the projects so that the
model is able to generate comments that have similar styles or follow
the same rules. It has been shown by prior work that it is tough for
models to generalize between projects. All the models using \mixedproj
\methodology have better performance than \evoaware \methodology
probably because of the difference in the size of training data.
%Contradicted with Hu et al. ~\cite{}, \DeepCom does not outperform 
%\Seq2seq and \Seq2seqAtt uniformly in all the settings. DeepCom does
%worse than two baselines in mixed and cross proj setting but best in
%temporally setting.
